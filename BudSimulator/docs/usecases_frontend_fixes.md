# Usecases Frontend Fixes

## Issue
The frontend was throwing runtime errors when accessing the `length` property of undefined arrays, particularly when the backend API was not available.

## Root Cause
- API calls were failing when backend was not running
- Components were trying to access `.length` on undefined arrays
- No fallback mechanism for when the API is unavailable

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Null Safety in Components

#### UsecaseList Component
- Added null checks for `usecases?.length || 0`
- Added fallback empty arrays in catch blocks
- Added null-safe array access: `(usecases || []).map(...)`
- Added condition: `(!usecases || usecases.length === 0)`

#### UsecaseFilters Component  
- Added null checks: `(availableIndustries || []).slice(...)`
- Added null checks: `(availableTags || []).slice(...)`
- Added length checks: `(availableIndustries || []).length > 5`

#### UsecaseCard Component
- Added existence check: `usecase.tags && usecase.tags.length > 0`
- Added null-safe access: `(usecase.tags || []).slice(0, 3)`

#### UsecaseDetail Component
- Added existence checks for arrays before rendering sections
- Added null-safe array mapping: `(usecase.typical_models || []).map(...)`

### 2. API Service Enhancements

#### Fallback to Mock Data
- Added try-catch blocks around all API calls
- Added 5-second timeout to prevent hanging requests
- Created comprehensive mock data for testing
- Added client-side filtering for mock data

#### Mock Data Features
- 5 sample usecases covering different industries and latency profiles
- Realistic performance requirements and SLO data
- Proper filtering logic that mirrors expected backend behavior
- Simulated API delays for realistic testing

### 3. Error Handling Improvements

#### Graceful Degradation
- Console warnings when API is unavailable (not errors)
- Automatic fallback to mock data in development
- Empty state handling when no data is available
- User-friendly error messages

#### State Management
- Proper initialization of arrays as empty arrays `[]`
- Fallback values in catch blocks
- Consistent state updates even when API fails

## Mock Data Structure

### Sample Usecases
1. **Real-time Chat Assistant** - Customer Service, real-time latency
2. **Document Summarization** - Legal & Finance, batch processing
3. **Code Generation Assistant** - Software Development, interactive
4. **Medical Image Analysis** - Healthcare, responsive
5. **Content Moderation** - Social Media, real-time

### Filter Options
- **Industries**: 10 different industries
- **Tags**: 19 common AI/ML tags
- **Latency Profiles**: real-time, interactive, responsive, batch

## Testing Scenarios

### With Backend Available
- All API calls work normally
- Real data from backend is displayed
- All filtering and pagination works

### Without Backend Available
- Automatic fallback to mock data
- Console warnings (not errors) about API unavailability
- All functionality works with simulated data
- Filtering and search work client-side

## Benefits

1. **Robust Development**: Frontend works independently of backend
2. **Better UX**: No crashes when API is down
3. **Easier Testing**: Mock data allows testing all UI states
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Smooth fallback experience
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear console warnings, not crashes

## Future Improvements

1. Add retry logic for failed API calls
2. Cache successful API responses
3. Add offline indicator when using mock data
4. Implement progressive loading for large datasets
5. Add more sophisticated error handling with user notifications
