# Logo and Model Analysis Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented logo scraping, storage, and serving functionality for the BudSimulator model management system, along with support for detailed model analysis data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `logo TEXT` column to store local logo file paths
- Added `model_analysis TEXT` column to store JSON analysis data
- Created migration script to update existing databases

### 2. Model Manager Updates
- Updated `add_model()` to accept `logo` and `model_analysis` parameters
- Updated `update_model()` to handle logo and analysis updates
- Modified `get_model_config()` to include logo and analysis in response

### 3. HuggingFace Integration
- Added `scrap_hf_logo()` method to scrape logos from HuggingFace model pages
- Added `_save_logo()` method to download and save logos locally
- Updated `import_model()` to automatically scrape and save logos
- Logos are saved in `BudSimulator/logos/` directory with sanitized filenames

### 4. API Updates
- Added static file serving for `/logos` directory
- Updated `/api/models/list` to return full logo URLs
- Added `ModelAnalysis` and `ModelAnalysisEval` schemas
- Created `ModelDetailResponse` schema for detailed model information
- Logo paths are automatically converted to full URLs in API responses

### 5. Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite in `test_extended_model_features.py`
- Tests cover database operations, logo scraping, and file saving
- All tests passing with proper mocking of external dependencies

## Usage

### Adding a Model with Logo
```bash
POST /api/models/add/huggingface
{
    "model_uri": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1",
    "auto_import": true
}
```

### Listing Models with Logos
```bash
GET /api/models/list
```
Response includes logo URLs like:
```json
{
    "model_id": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1",
    "logo": "http://localhost:8000/logos/mistralai_Mistral-7B-v0.1.png",
    ...
}
```

### Getting Model Details
```bash
GET /api/models/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1
```
Returns full model details including configuration and analysis.

## Migration for Existing Databases
Run the migration script to add the new columns:
```bash
cd BudSimulator
python -m src.db.migrate
```

## Notes
- Logos are scraped using CSS/XPath selectors from HuggingFace pages
- Failed logo downloads are handled gracefully (model import continues)
- Logo URLs in API responses are absolute and can be directly used by frontends
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality 

# Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of extended model features including logo support and model analysis fields in the BudSimulator database and API.

## Database Schema Updates

### New Columns Added to `models` Table
1. **`logo` (TEXT)**: Stores the URL or path to the model's logo image
2. **`model_analysis` (TEXT)**: Stores JSON data containing:
   - `description`: Model description
   - `advantages`: List of model advantages
   - `disadvantages`: List of model disadvantages
   - `usecases`: List of use cases
   - `evals`: Array of evaluation scores with name and score

### Migration
- Created `BudSimulator/src/db/migrate.py` to add missing columns to existing databases
- Migration checks for existing columns before adding to avoid errors
- Database path: `~/.genz_simulator/db/models.db`

## Logo Implementation

### Logo Scraping
- Added `scrap_hf_logo()` method in `HuggingFaceModelImporter`
- Extracts organization name from model ID (e.g., "openai" from "openai/whisper-large-v3")
- Scrapes logo from HuggingFace organization page
- Downloads and saves logos locally in `BudSimulator/logos/` directory

### Logo Storage
- Logos are saved with sanitized filenames (e.g., `openai_whisper-large-v3.png`)
- Database stores relative path (e.g., `logos/openai_whisper-large-v3.png`)
- API converts relative paths to full URLs when serving

### API Updates
- Added static file serving for `/logos` path in FastAPI
- All model endpoints return full logo URLs
- Logo URLs are automatically converted from relative to absolute paths

## Model Analysis with LLM Integration

### Text Extraction
- Created `BudSimulator/src/utils/text_extraction.py` with `extract_text_from_huggingface()` function
- Extracts and cleans model card content from HuggingFace pages
- Handles HTML parsing, table extraction, and text formatting
- Includes error handling for rate limiting and access issues

### LLM Integration
- Created `BudSimulator/src/utils/llm_integration.py` with utilities for:
  - `parse_model_analysis()`: Extracts JSON from LLM responses
  - `validate_analysis()`: Validates and cleans analysis data
  - `get_empty_analysis()`: Returns empty analysis structure
- Created `BudSimulator/src/utils/bud_llm.py` as a mock BudLLM integration
  - In production, replace with actual BudLLM service integration

### Model Analysis Process
1. When importing a model from HuggingFace:
   - First checks if model card has structured analysis data
   - If not available, extracts text from HuggingFace model page
   - Sends extracted text to LLM with MODEL_ANALYSIS_PROMPT
   - Parses LLM response to extract structured analysis
   - Validates and stores analysis in database

### Prompt Engineering
- Uses existing `MODEL_ANALYSIS_PROMPT` from `BudSimulator/src/prompts.py`
- Prompt guides LLM to extract:
  - Model description (2-5 sentences)
  - Advantages (list of factual strengths)
  - Disadvantages (list of limitations)
  - Use cases (practical applications)
  - Evaluation scores (benchmark results)

## Frontend Updates

### Logo Display
- Created `ModelLogo` and `ModelLogoWithFallback` components
- Added logo support in all model displays:
  - Popular Models section (Home screen)
  - Model Information (Calculator screen)
  - Models list (Models tab)
  - Comparison table
- Automatic fallback to default icon if image fails to load
- Three size options: 'sm', 'md', 'lg'

### Model Analysis Display
- Model analysis data is included in API responses
- Frontend can display:
  - Model description
  - Advantages/disadvantages lists
  - Use cases
  - Evaluation scores

## API Endpoints Updated

### GET /api/models/{model_id}/config
- Now returns `model_analysis` field with full analysis data
- Includes logo URL

### GET /api/models/popular
- Returns logo URLs for all popular models
- Analysis data available if model is in database

### GET /api/models/list
- Includes logo URLs for all models
- Converts relative paths to full URLs

### GET /api/models/{model_id}
- Full model details including analysis and logo

### POST /api/models/add/huggingface
- Automatically scrapes logo when importing
- Performs LLM analysis if model card lacks structured data

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive test suite in `BudSimulator/tests/test_extended_model_features.py`
- Created LLM integration tests in `BudSimulator/tests/test_model_analysis_integration.py`
- Tests cover:
  - Logo scraping and storage
  - Model analysis parsing
  - API endpoint responses
  - Database operations
  - Text extraction from HuggingFace
  - LLM response parsing and validation

### Test Fixtures
- Uses temporary databases for isolation
- Mocks external dependencies (HuggingFace API, LLM calls)
- Validates data integrity and transformations

## Dependencies Added
- `beautifulsoup4`: For HTML parsing in text extraction
- `json_repair`: For fixing malformed JSON from LLM responses
- `lxml`: For efficient HTML/XML parsing

## Future Enhancements
1. Replace mock BudLLM with actual service integration
2. Add caching for LLM analysis results
3. Implement batch analysis for multiple models
4. Add support for custom model analysis prompts
5. Implement analysis quality scoring
6. Add support for updating analysis when model cards change

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Schema Updates (`BudSimulator/src/db/schema.py`)
- Added `logo TEXT` column to models table
- Added `model_analysis TEXT` column to models table

### 2. Model Manager Updates (`BudSimulator/src/db/model_manager.py`)
- Updated `add_model()` to accept `logo` and `model_analysis` parameters
- Updated `update_model()` to handle logo and model_analysis updates
- Modified `get_model_config()` to return logo and model_analysis fields

### 3. HuggingFace Integration (`BudSimulator/src/db/hf_integration.py`)
- Added `scrap_hf_logo()` method to scrape logos from HuggingFace organization pages
  - Extracts organization name from model ID (e.g., "openai" from "openai/whisper-large-v3")
  - Fetches logo from organization's HuggingFace page
- Added `_save_logo()` method to download and save logos locally
- Modified `import_model()` to automatically scrape and save logos
- Created `BudSimulator/logos/` directory for storing downloaded logos

### 4. API Updates
- **Main App (`BudSimulator/apis/main.py`)**:
  - Added static file serving for `/logos` path
  - Maps to `BudSimulator/logos/` directory

- **Models Router (`BudSimulator/apis/routers/models.py`)**:
  - Updated `list_all_models` endpoint to convert relative logo paths to full URLs
  - Logo URLs are returned as `http://host:port/logos/filename`

- **Schemas (`BudSimulator/apis/schemas.py`)**:
  - Added `ModelAnalysisEval` schema for evaluation scores
  - Added `ModelAnalysis` schema for model analysis data
  - Added `ModelDetailResponse` schema with logo and model_analysis fields
  - Updated `ModelSummary` to include optional logo field

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Type Definitions Updates
Added logo field to the following TypeScript interfaces:
- `ModelConfig`: Added `logo?: string`
- `PopularModel`: Added `logo?: string`
- `ModelSummary`: Added `logo?: string`
- `ComparisonItem`: Added `logo?: string`

### 2. Logo Display Components
Created two logo components:
- **`ModelLogo`**: Basic logo component with fallback to default icon
- **`ModelLogoWithFallback`**: Enhanced component with error handling for failed image loads

Features:
- Three size options: 'sm', 'md', 'lg'
- Automatic fallback to gradient Database icon if logo fails to load
- Rounded corners and proper styling to match the UI

### 3. UI Updates
Updated the following sections to display model logos:

#### Popular Models Section (Home Screen)
- Shows logo next to model name
- Uses medium size logos
- Maintains hover effects and styling

#### Model Information (Calculator Screen)
- Displays logo in the model information header
- Shows next to "Model Information" title

#### Model Comparison Table
- Shows small logos in the model column
- Displays alongside model name and precision

#### Models List Screen
- Replaces default Database icon with actual model logos
- Shows medium size logos in model cards

### 4. Logo Behavior
- If a model has a logo URL, it displays the image
- If the image fails to load (404, network error, etc.), it automatically falls back to the default gradient icon
- The default icon uses a purple-to-pink gradient with a Database icon, matching the app's design language

## Usage

### Adding a Model with Logo
```python
model_manager.add_model(
    model_id="openai/whisper-large-v3",
    config=config_dict,
    logo="logos/openai_whisper-large-v3.png",
    model_analysis={
        "description": "Speech recognition model",
        "advantages": ["High accuracy", "Multilingual"],
        "disadvantages": ["Large size"],
        "usecases": ["Transcription", "Translation"],
        "evals": [{"name": "WER", "score": 0.95}]
    }
)
```

### Importing from HuggingFace
```python
importer = HuggingFaceModelImporter()
importer.import_model("openai/whisper-large-v3")
# Automatically scrapes and saves logo
```

### Frontend Display
The frontend automatically displays logos wherever models are shown:
- Popular models grid on home screen
- Model information in calculator
- Model comparison table
- Models list screen

If a logo is not available or fails to load, a default gradient icon is displayed maintaining visual consistency.

## Notes
- Logo scraping respects rate limits with 1-second delays
- Downloaded logos are saved with sanitized filenames
- The system maintains backward compatibility - logo field is optional
- Migration script available for existing databases
